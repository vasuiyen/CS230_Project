# CS230_Project
Identifying Driver Intention from Vehicle Controller Dataset. This project is implemented using RNN model


Project Team - Elliot, Yijun and Vasu (Stanford Students)

LSTM_Classification_Vehicle_Sensor_Data.ipynb --> Has the google colab run module for classifying driver's driving behaviour
LSTM_Prediction_Vehicle_Sensor_Data.ipynb     --> Has the google colab run module for predicting vehicle control data for next 't' seconds
LSTM_Classification_POC.ipynb                 --> Has the POC google colab module on usage of RNN for vehicle control data set

Rest of all other ipynb modules development modules which are already implemented in the above 3 modules.
